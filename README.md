# DiscordFileBot
An in-chat file serving bot for Discord


# **Discord File Bot**
*An in-chat file management application for quick, on-demand file access*

<br />

### Welcome to DiscordFileBot!
<hr>

This repository contains my scaffolding for a Discord chat-bot application named FileBot (@filebot). The bot will manage the text channels detailed in *Get Started* and *Usage*, and use those different channels to act as an on-demand file server, without polluting the server with pinned messages or a scaling demand for file storage on the server. The files served can be tailored by the implementation, and the following document will exhibit mine.

### Acknowledgements üíô
<hr>

Thanks to my girlfriend Jean, for helping me test this Bot on my testing server across its target channels. Certainly worth mentioning, the Discord.js docs contains a [guide]() that's terrific! I originally wrote bots with a rapid development template that made feature implementation rigid, only to later realize that writing it from the ground up is fun and welll-documented!
