# DiscordFileBot
An in-chat file serving bot for Discord


# **Discord File Bot**
*An in-chat file management application for quick, on-demand file access*

<br />

### Welcome to DiscordFileBot!
<hr>

This repository contains my scaffolding for a Discord chat-bot application named FileBot (@filebot). The bot will manage the text channels detailed in *Get Started* and *Usage*, and use those different channels to act as an on-demand file server, without polluting the server with pinned messages or a scaling demand for file storage on the server. The files served can be tailored by the implementation, and the following document will exhibit mine.

<br />

### Get Started üöÄ
<hr>

First thing's first, make sure you have already initialized the working directory as a `Node` applicaiton:
```bash
npm init
```

feel free to run `npm install`, else here are the two dependancies for **FileBot**:
```bash
npm install discord.js
npm install eslint
```

Navigate to `~/eslintrc.json` to enforce your own code styles by the appending the *rules* object:
```json
{
	"extends": "eslint:recommended",
	"env": {
		"node": true,
		"es6": true
	},
	"parserOptions": {
		"ecmaVersion": 2019
	},
	"rules": {

	}
}
```

If you haven't already, create the application and add it as a bot at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and retrieve your bot token.


Place the token, and whatever in-chat prefix you wish to address the bot with in `~/config.json`
```json
{
    "prefix" : "<prefered_wake_signature_here>",
    "token" : "<bot_token_here"
}
```

Try running your bot and look for "ready!" logged to your runtime console:
```bash
node .
```

Adding new file services is easy, just hop on over to newFileService.md, or take a look at `commands/test.js`.
If you would like to add other new utility commands, see newCommand.md for tailoring this bot to suit your specific application.

<br />

### Usage ‚öô
<hr>

Before the file service is covered, there are a few utility commands this bot has that a *server admin* might find useful.

You can display the avatars of any string of *mentioned* server members in one message:
```
!avatar @SleepyBoy @AwakeyGirl
```

Or just the callers avatar:
```
!avatar
```

You can get server details with:
```
!server
```

And you can delete any number of previous messages in the current channel swiftly, provided they are less than two weeks old (server admin only):
```
!prune 4
```

Now onto the file service!
For a given file you want to maintain versions of and have on demand, you simply follow the short list of steps in newFileService.md, and you can request any version of a file simply with:
```
!haikus -2
```
which would have **FileBot** serve you *haikus-v2.txt*, presumably.

If you simply want the latest version, just don't include the version number:
```
!haikus
```
which would return the latest version, say *haikus-v4.txt*. This service works for any file extension.

### Contribute ü§ù
<hr>

I am not currently evaluating pull requests for merging, but would gladly accept feedback from any savy Discord Bot developers!

<br />

### Acknowledgements üíô
<hr>

Thanks to my girlfriend Jean, for helping me test this Bot on my testing server across its target channels. Certainly worth mentioning, the Discord.js docs contains a [guide]() that's terrific! I originally wrote bots with a rapid development template that made feature implementation rigid, only to later realize that writing it from the ground up is fun and welll-documented!
